<h1>The Open Voice Factory</h1>
<h2> Grid generation</h2>
<p>To make your own communication aid, there are there simple steps. </p>
<ol>
<li> Watch our <a href=guides.html>3 minute getting started video</a></li>
<li> Make some changes to either our  <a href=https://raw.github.com/joereddington/CommuniKate/master/ck12/CK12%2BV2.pptx>CK12 template</a> or <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joereddington/CommuniKate/master/ck20/CK20V2.pptx>CK20 template</a>. </li>
<li> Upload your version using the form below. </li>
</ol>
<form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" class="file-submit">
  <h3>File to upload</h3>
<p>The Open Voice Factory is simple.  There are NO usernames, NO passwords.  Just upload a template and youâ€™ll be given a special link that you can always use to get back to the communication device you created. </p>
    <input type="file" name="fileToUpload" id="fileToUpload">
    <br>
    <h3>Grid size</h3>
    <input type="radio" name="size" value="5" class="size"> 5 wide and 5 tall<br>
    <br>
    <input type="radio" name="size" value="4" class="size"> 4 wide and 4 tall<br>
    <br>
<h3>Nationality for spoken voice</h3>
    <select name="lang" id="lang">
    </select>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <button class="button" data-tooltip="Please select a file and a gridsize first!" disabled>Process uploaded file</button>
</form>

<p>Please note that the Open Voice Factory is in Beta - it's for testing only right now, we aren't recommending it for deployment with users yet.</p> <p> At  this stage of development, anyone with the correct link will be able to view your files. Please keep this in mind before uploading content that may be private. </p>
